                    <p>
                        History of soccer goes back to more than 2,000 years ago, the sport was played by the people in many parts of the world like China, Greek, Rome, and Central America.
                        But it was England that changed the old sport into what is today. The English were the first people to play the game similar to what is being played today, wearing two sets of uniform, applying ruls to the sport. 
                        As the sport developed, more rules were implemented. In 1913 FIFA became a member of the International Football Association Board of Great Britain. In 1970 red and yellow cards were introduced during the World Cup finals. 
                        In 1992 goalkeepers were banned from handling deliberate back passes and in 1998 tackles from behind became red-card penalties.

                        Cricket's history goes back to late 16th century. first played in south-east England, and it became the country's national sport in the 18th century. 
                        Cricket was considerd as children's game for many generations before it started to be played by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. 
                        Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. 
                        Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool as the ball; a stick or a crook as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate as the wicket.

                    <p>
                        Winter of 1891-1892, inside a gymnasium at Springfield College, located in Springfield, Massachusetts, a group of students under their instructors (James Naismith) leadership started playing a game (known as the International YMCA Training School).
                        James Naismith's idea was to keep the young men (students) motivated after the football season was over. 
                        He came up with this new game that was easy to assimilate, complex enough to be interesting, playable indoors or on any kind of ground, and by a large number of players all at once, to keep younger people busy.
                        Because of the College’s well-represented international student body, basketball was introduced to many foreign nations in a short period of time, and by 1905, basketball was officially recognized as a permanent winter sport.

                    <p>
                        Field hockey is one of the oldest team sports in the world, dating back nearly 3,000 years to the Greek classical era. The same with Soccer and Cricket great britain playes a huge rule in the reformation of the sport.
                        Field hockey reached its modern form in the 19th century as a game played between two teams of eleven players each. Teams compete on a standard 100 x 60 yard field and attempt to score goals by hitting a ball off the ground into a net guarded by the opposite team.
                        In 1886, the Hockey Association was founded in England, publishing a set of rules and standards. The sport went mainstream in 1908 when it was included in the Summer Olympics in London, but was dropped form the olympics in 1924 and soon after in 1928 Hockey was reinstated as an Olympic sport.

                    <h4>History of Tennis</h4>
                    <p>
                        Historical development of Tennis goes back several thousands of years, but the tennis game we play today was developed from a  12th century French handball game called "Paume" (palm), originally practised with bare hands.
                        Designed and codified in England in the 1870s, and in 1877, the first Tennis tournament was held at Wimbledon. 
                        The rules of this tournament set the standard for tennis as it's played today—with some notable differences: service was exclusively underhand and women were not allowed to play in the tournament until 1884.
